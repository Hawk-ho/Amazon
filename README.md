# Amazon - A Collection of Small JavaScript Projects
Welcome to the Amazon repository! This collection contains small projects that I built while learning JavaScript. The goal of these projects was to practice and enhance my skills in JavaScript, and they cover a variety of fundamental concepts.

# 🚀 Project Overview
This repository includes multiple small JavaScript projects that demonstrate various programming techniques and concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, functions, and arrays. These projects are great for anyone starting out with JavaScript or looking to reinforce their understanding of core JavaScript features.

# 📝 List of Projects
Project 1: [cart Quantity]
This project displays cart of Quantity that you could give it a look through console. 


Project 2: [simple game]
rock scissors paper , this project comes with three versions each of them is develop version of the previous one.

Project 3: [subscribe button]
this is simple project that the subscribe button is changed when you click on it

<h3> there are other projects you could discover it by your self</h3>

# 🛑 Status of the Repository
I started building this collection by following tutorials but ultimately decided to seek other resources to develop my own problem-solving skills and write code independently. As a result, some of the projects may be incomplete or not fully polished. My journey is ongoing, and I’m continually learning and improving.

# 📚 Future Plans
Although I did not complete the full tutorial series, I am focused on applying what I’ve learned to build more independent and self-driven projects in the future. The repository will evolve as I gain more experience and refine my coding abilities.



# 💡 Learnings and Reflections
Throughout the process of building these projects, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of:

JavaScript syntax and features
DOM manipulation
Event handling
Problem-solving in a programming context
I learned that following tutorials alone isn't sufficient for me to build projects independently, which is why I’m now exploring other resources that encourage self-driven learning and project-building.

This is a personal learning repository, but feel free to fork it or contribute with suggestions, improvements, or your own projects!

🙏 Acknowledgements
A special thanks to the creators of the tutorials I followed, as they provided the foundational knowledge for these projects.
